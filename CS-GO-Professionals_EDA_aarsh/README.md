## Description

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a 2012 multiplayer first-person shooter developed by Valve and Hidden Path Entertainment. It is the fourth game in the Counter-Strike series.

The entire flow of the project includes:
- Scrape the Dataset from this [Website](https://www.hltv.org/stats/players)
- Perform Feature Engineering to create insightful columns
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis to create insights and meaningful dashboards
